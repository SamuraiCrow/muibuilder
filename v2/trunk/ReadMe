        To install MUIBuilder, you just have to click
        on the 'Installer' Icon ( find it in the 'Install' directory ) !
        You need to have the Commodore Installer in your SYS:Utilities/
        directory.

        the installation is available in 8 languages:

                - Français
                - Deutsch
                - English

        Chose your prefered language, and follow the instructions ...

        If you don't have the Commodore Installer :
                - copy Env/ to ENV: & ENVARC:
                - copy Libs/ to LIBS:
                - copy the MB/ directory where you want MUIBuilder
                  to be.
                - make a directory 'documentations' in the root directory
                  of MUIBuilder, and put your documentation in it under
                  the name 'MUIBuilder.guide'
                - copy the locale file in the right directory
                  'LOCALE:catalogs/xxxx' where xxxxx is your language name.

                ########## MAGIC WORKBENCH #########

        The different icons are in Magic-Workbench 2.0 style.
        Some of them come directly from the Magic-Workbench package.

        Magic Workbench is a shareware product copyrighted
        by   >>>>>>>>>>  Martin Huttenloher <<<<<<<<<<<<<
        You can find his wonderful package on Aminet or
        on lot of good PD disks !!!

        You can register MagicWB by sending DM 30.- or US$ 20.- to :

                        Martin Huttenloher
                        Am HochStraess 4
                        D- 89081 Ulm
                        Germany/Europe

        If you want to use immediately the icons and haven't got MagicWB yet,
        then copy the Misc/palette.prefs file to your ENV: and ENVARC:
        directories and use an 8 colours workbench. (this palette.prefs
        file comes from WB3.0).

        I put in this archive only drawers which were used by other people
        in other distributions (such as MUI for example) : in this way
        i don't distribute new drawer icons, except those i drawn myself
        (i put my name in these ones, so that nobody could think MagicWB
        is a crap !! But it is really easy to recognize the icons I've
        drawn  : they are not so beautiful as the MagiWB ones !!)

        You can distribute my icons as long as you keep my name inside !!!

        Please : register MagicWB : it is worth the price !!!

        Note to Martin : you can take my icons and make what you want with them !!

                ########## More Icons ##########

        The beautiful C-project icons in the C/ directory were drawn
        by Walter Dörwald.

        You can find other icons for MUIBuilder in the Misc/ directory.
         - one using the MagicWb palette (by Jan Skypala)
         - and three 4 colours icons to use with a standard amiga palette
           (drawn by Jérôme Chesnot)
